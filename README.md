 ## Election Audit Summary
 We were able to figure out quite a lot of info about the election using the script. Apart from using this script for calcukating the results that we did, we can use this scripts for the following elections and other resuls too:
 
 - The script can be used as-is to tabulate similar results for a Senatorial elecion. In addition to results that we already have, we can also get the following results for a Senatorial Election:
  - The script can be modified/enhanced to also calculate which candidate won which county/congressional district. This will allow to figure out if there are geographic regions where a certain candidate is stronger than other regions. Political parties and candidates will be able to plan better for futre elections and invest/campaign in counties based on their strnegth and weaknesses.
  - If the data captured from elections can include the gender of each voter, the script can be enhanced to perform analysis on how the candidates performed among different genders of the voting population. The results from such an analysis would give insights into gender preferences for each candidate and would help candidates plan their strategy accordingly.
